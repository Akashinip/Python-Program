Solution:

1. In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?

expenses = [2200,2350,2600,2130,2190]
print("Expenses spent extra on feb is: ", expenses[1]-expenses [0])

2. Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year.

expenses = [2200,2350,2600,2130,2190]

quarter_tot = 0
i = 0
while i < 3:
     quarter_tot += expenses[i]
      i += 1
print("Quarter Expense: ", quarter_tot)

3. Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
   print("Expenses spent extra on feb is: ", expenses[1]-expenses [0])
quarter_tot = 0
for i in range(len(expenses)):
    if expenses[i] == 2000:
        print(i)
else: 
        print("There is no such entry")
        
4. June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
expenses.append(1980)
print(expenses)

expenses[3] -= 200
print(expenses[3])
